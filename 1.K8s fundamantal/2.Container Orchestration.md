# Benefits of Container Orchestration

Container orchestration offers multiple advantages:

- **High Availability:** Mitigate downtime by running multiple container instances across different nodes.
- **Load Balancing:** Evenly distribute user traffic across containers.
- **Scalability:** Seamlessly deploy additional instances as demand increases.
- **Flexibility:** Scale services and adjust underlying nodes without interrupting operations.
- **Simplicity:** Manage functionalities with declarative object configuration files.

# Tools
- **Docker Swarm:** Offers a straightforward setup but may lack advanced features for complex applications.
- **Apache Mesos:** Provides robust functionality but can be challenging to configure initially.
- **Kubernetes:** Though it might require extra effort for initial setup, it provides extensive customization, **supports complex architectures**, and is integrated with all major **public cloud providers such as GCP, Azure, and AWS.** Its **popularity** is also evident on GitHub.
