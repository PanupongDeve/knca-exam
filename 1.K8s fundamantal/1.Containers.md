- Docker can run any flavor of OS on top of it as long as they are all based on the same kernel
- If the underlying OS is Ubuntu, docker can run a container based on another distribution like debian, fedora, suse or centos.
- Windows ! And so you wont be able to run a windows based container on a Docker host with Linux OS on it. For that you would require docker on a windows server

- Developer: Guide information about how the hosts must be setup with Dockerfile
- Operations: image can now run on any container platform and is guaranteed to run the same way everywhere -> improv productivity to deploy
- image was already working when the developer built it and operations are not modifying it, it continues to work the same when deployed in production
